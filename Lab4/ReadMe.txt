Since the zipped archive containing the necessary input images exceeds the allowed dimension on aulaweb, the images 
weren't added to the archive. Therefore in order to make the script work it's necessary to add the input images to the folder.

The images are loaded on aulaweb at this link: https://2018.aulaweb.unige.it/mod/resource/view.php?id=61144
